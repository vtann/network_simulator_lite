# Comments about plan

The planned object structure looks well justified, and the class
structure models the network elements in appropriate way. There is not
much about what the content of the classes might be, for example
initial thoughts about algorithms to be used in implementation. The
text refers to graphical UI, but there is not much concrete about how
this will be done. Are you using SFML, Qt, or some other library?

The class diagram is a bit unclear about what kind of relationships
there are between classes: when there is inheritance and when e.g.
references between the classes?

The part about tools and timing is good, and seems realistic. However,
there is nothing about distribution of work and roles between the
team: who does what?
