### This is an example readme for the project.

This repository contains three subdirectories:

* plan/ for the plan 
* doc/  for the final documentation
* src/  for all the source code

Network simulator models a group of network nodes, and links that connect 
the nodes. The nodes communicate with each other by sending and receiving 
packets. Each node can have multiple interfaces and each interface will 
have its own IP address and MAC address. There are roughly two kinds of 
nodes: routers, that forward packets intended to other nodes; and end-hosts 
that run an application that either sends or receives packets (or does both). 
Sometimes a node can act in both roles. Each link can be described by 
two basic characteristics: transmission speed, that determines the interval 
at which new packets can be transmitted to the link; and propagation delay, 
which is the time it takes for packet to travel across the link.
